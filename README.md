# Team NA Coders


## Project team:

* [Nathaniel Rupsis](https://github.com/rupsis/) (team captain)
* [Hoa Le](https://github.com/hle027)


## Project details:
The NA Coders will be competing in the IR (Information Retrieval) competition. 

Our team is prepared to research, test, and implement state of the art search methods and techniques. For this project, we'll be using python, and focusing on implementing and tuning the methods mentioned in the proposal(query expansion, feedback, rank fusion, etc). Time permitting, we'll test out and incorporate additional retrieval methods listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Information_retrieval_techniques), such as [Compound term processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound-term_processing) and [Contextual Searching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_searching).
